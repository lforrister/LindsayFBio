<p> Hi! I'm Lindsay. I was born in 1994 in Midland, Michigan, before moving to the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 2, where I remained until I left for college. In Atlanta, I attended a performing arts high school, where I majored in voice and minored in drama. This led me to audition for Southern Methodist University's vocal program, which led me to the Lone Star State! </p>
<p> I attended Southern Methodist University from 2012-2016 with a double major in music and creative advertising with a minor in graphic design. While in school, I was involved in Chi Omega Sorority, along with several other extracurriculars. Post grad, I am working as a graphic designer at a magazine company in Dallas. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, going out to concerts and events, singing, playing piano, attending concerts, exploring fun new restauraunts, eating pizza, binging netflix, and playing with cats. </p>
